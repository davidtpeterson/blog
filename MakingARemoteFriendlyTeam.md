# Making a Remote Friendly Team 

## Summary 

Whether you are working full time remote, are working from home for a day, or even just have remote people on your team, there are some things to keep in mind to make sure that the different dynamics work well together to make the team successful.  

## Basic Needs 

In any kind of healthy work environment, there are certain baseline requirements that need to be met for the team to be able to work productively together.  This document will focus on the following requirements: 

* Need to see and hear coworkers 
* Need to be actively included in discussions 
* Need to be able to actively collaborate 
* Need to be able to share knowledge 
* Need for community 

For teams that are 100% in the office, a lot of this is space dependent. If a team is co-located then, barring any disabilities, you'll be able to see and hear each other. Some amount of knowledge sharing, collaboration, inclusion, and community will come along with this. The arrangement of the space and the culture of the team also impact this significantly.   However, when even one person on the team is not co-located with the rest of the team, the team as a whole needs to start thinking in terms of being remote, even if they're in the office.  Otherwise the remote person(s) will always be at a huge disadvantage, and the team will not get the full benefit of their remote team members. 

There are a number of adjustments that must be made to make a hybrid or fully remote team successful. Probably the most important is simply having the right tools available to enable the basic needs of the team. 

## Day to Day (What does this look like?) 

### Chat (i.e. Slack, Teams, etc)

#### Profile 

Since the chat tool will likely be the mostly heavily utilized, make sure to at least have your basic information filled so people know who they're talking to, or can find you if needed. At minimum your profile should include: 

A profile picture that people can recognize you by. With (preferably) a clear view of your face. If someone meets you in person for the first time, they should be able to recognize you based on your profile picture. 

Where you are located (what office you work out of typically, even if that's your Remote home office) 

Your team name 

Other things that can be helpful to include are your local time and other contact information like email or phone number. 

#### Attention 

Chat apps provide a nice asynchronous method of communication. This makes it easy to respond when you have time. So while you don't need to always have it up, it's good to at least check it every hour as you're able.  

#### Communication Style 

Be clear, verbose, and courteous. Don't expect answers right away, but try to respond in as timely a manner as you're able. 

### Meetings (Zoom, Teams, Bluejeans, GoToMeeting, etc.)

#### Cameras 

Every single person in the meeting should have a camera that shows them clearly. Good rule of thumb is that a deaf person should be able to read your lips. 

This is easiest for remote people because each person is likely attending via their own interface.  If people are in a room, additional tooling may be required. 

#### Microphones 

Every single person in the meeting should have their voice clearly heard by a microphone with minimal or no background noise.  

Good rules of thumb: 
If you have to speak up so the people that aren't in the room with you can hear you, you need a better microphone situation. 

If there is a lot of background noise coming through the microphone, you need a better microphone situation. 

This is easiest for remote people because each person is likely attending via their own interface.  If people are in a room, additional tooling may be required. 

If you are attending from your desk in an open workspace or a busy coffee shop, be sure your microphone has active noise cancelling so the extra noise doesn't leak through. 

Always join meetings muted and only un-mute when you're talking.  
This will keep background noise from interrupting when you're not talking (or at least keep your coworkers ears in tact when you sneeze into the mic). 

#### Screen Shares.

Any data that is being discussed that some people can see should be made available to everyone to see just as clearly. In the case of screen sharing, the tooling should allow screen sharing while still allowing everyone to see and hear each other. 

#### Whiteboards 

Whiteboards are for in-office people only. Even when you have a camera directly on the whiteboard, remote people cannot fully participate by writing on the whiteboard themselves.  If white-boarding is part of how people work, get a digital whiteboarding tool. There are several options out there, including whiteboards that allow for remote interaction, or even just virtual whiteboards that are included with tools like Zoom.  If you need to whiteboard something and there are remote people on your team, use these tools instead. 

#### One Conversation 

It is difficult for many people to listen to more than one conversation at a time in person. It is exponentially harder to do so when you're not all in the same room.  Keep the entirety of the meeting to one conversation with one person speaking at once. 

If you need to talk to just one person, don't lower your voice, leave the room. Everything said in the room should be heard by everyone. 

### Work Tracking (Jira, Zendesk, etc) 

Keep it clear and up to date so everyone knows what work is still available, what needs to be done, and what might need help. 

### Coffee Talk 

Casual conversations happen pretty naturally in an office, whether in the team's work space or a common area like a kitchen. Both in office and remote teammembers should consider reaching out to those you don't see in person to catch up and have a casual conversation with.  If you haven't spoken to a member of your team in a while, ask yourself why and/or reach out and chat. 

This can also be useful to meet people outside of your team whether you are remote or just kinda shy. Try reaching out to people you don't know, or would like to know better. 

## Remote-Specific Work Responsibilities & Considerations 

### Suggestions for Work/Life Balance 

It can be difficult to strike an appropriate balance between work and non-work when your office is just steps or clicks away from the rest of your life.  Here are some ideas for not letting work take over your life, and vice versa. 

#### Have a dedicated work space 

We create mental associations with activities and the spaces we do them in. Having a dedicated work space can help you transition into and out of the work mindset. 

#### Set work hours. Obey them. 

Having specific time set aside for work has several benefits.  It can help keep you from working all night. It lets your coworkers know when they should be able to reach you. And it can also help you maintain boundaries against any creeping non-work distractions. Having clear boundaries defined will help set expectations. 

#### Take breaks 

It's tempting to go overboard on being always available and tied to your desk when remote. Get up and give yourself a break regularly. Move, clear your head. Go get a cup of coffee from that coffee shop down the street. Your body and brain will thank you. 

#### Don't eat at your desk

Take time to care for yourself throughout the day. Your coworkers in the office likely don't eat at their desks. It's a good time to take a break. 

### Suggestions for Connectedness 

It's easy to become isolated when working remotely. Casual conversations don't present themselves as naturally and it can be easy to avoid getting to know your coworkers. Here are some ideas for keeping your social needs met at work. 

#### Talk to people on your team regularly

If you haven't talked to a team member for a while, ask yourself why not? Consider arranging a little 1:1 chat like you might have if you ran into them in the kitchen. Offer to pair with them on a task or ask them for help with yours.  

#### Talk to random people regularly 

Consider reaching out to random people within your company and asking if they'd take some time to chat with you about what they do.  

### In-Office-Specific Work Responsibilities & Considerations

#### Special Events 

Special events, swag, free lunches are not just for people in the office. Especially if you have a hybrid team, make sure no remote people are left out. 

#### Hallway Conversations 

If you just discussed changing that one little thing to someone in person, consider at least posting the results of that conversation to the team chat channel. This will keep everyone that wasn't in ear-shot update, and give them a chance to opine. 

This also applies to side conversations in Slack or otherwise. When a conclusion is reached, consider whether it would be useful for everyone to know about it.
